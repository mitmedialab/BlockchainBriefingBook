## Regarding Smart Contracts

**SMART AFTER ALL: BLOCKCHAIN, SMART CONTRACTS, PARAMETRIC INSURANCE, AND SMART ENERGY GRIDS**; Alan Cohn, Travis West, & Chelsea Parker 
* CITE AS: 1 GEO. L. TECH. REV. 273 (2017)
* Perma: https://perma.cc/TY7W-Q8CX
> "A threshold question for the wide-scale use of blockchain-based smart contracts is whether such smart contracts are legally enforceable. This Article argues that existing laws, specifically the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“ESIGN”) and state laws modeled on the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act (“UETA”), render blockchain-based smart contracts enforceable and therefore immediately usable."

**SMART CONTRACTS: A SMART WAY TO AUTOMATE  PERFORMANCE**; Jenny Cieplak and Simon Leefatt
*  CITE AS: 1 GEO. L. TECH. REV. 417 (2017) 
*  Perma: https://perma.cc/EUT6-RL6P
> "Of course, to take advantage of remedies only available in court, the counterparty to the contract must be identifiable. The recent DAO hack illustrates this point best. Unknown hackers exploited a weakness in the code of the DAO contract and withdrew Ether from investors who were parties to the DAO contract. The reason why other participants in the DAO had no recourse against the hackers was not due to some perceived difference between smart contracts and traditional contracts, but because the parties against whom the contract would be enforced were unknown.  This is a key argument in favor of permissioned ledgers, where parties’ identities are known and validated."

### Formation Issues: Clear Record of Mutual Asset to the Terms

**Smart Contracts: Legal Agreements for the Blockchain**; Reggie O'Shields
* CITE AS: 21 N.C. BANKING INST. 177 (2017).
* URL: http://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1435&context=ncbi 
> "...an enforceable smart contract must have a clear record of mutual assent to the terms—such as clicking on an “agree” button—and it must clearly disclose the terms to the contracting parties. Courts have been more likely to uphold agreements that meet these conditions. In a recent case, a court found manifestation of mutual assent in an online transaction when three factors were present: (1) a conspicuous notice of the terms of use for an online transaction, (2) an express warning that proceeding further with the transaction would bind the party to the terms, and (3) an express agreement by the user to the terms and conditions at the time of account creation."


### Evidentiary Issues

**The Law and Legality of Smart Contracts**; Max Raskin; 
* Cite as: 1 GEO. L. TECH. REV. 304 (2017)
* Perma: https://perma.cc/UC8L-KTW3
> "...Smart contracts may pose particular evidentiary issues given that the contract is written in computer code. This code would need to be produced in natural language for a court to review as part of a dispute, since it is unlikely that courts would possess the requisite expertise to review the code directly. This problem could be handled prospectively by developing and maintaining an isolated version of the code translated into natural language when the smart contract goes into effect, which could be updated as changes to it are made. This should not be burdensome to developers of this technology in that they will need to provide a natural language version of the contract to the parties to obtain mutual consent. Furthermore, additional expertise and specialization in smart contract technology would be needed to validate the smart contract in any litigation, including verifying that the security protocols are sufficient to maintain the code in its agreed upon state."

> "...The Supreme Court’s First Amendment jurisprudence provides a useful model; n that realm, the Court has erred on the side of respecting autonomy and policing ex post. In this instance, contractware ought not be analyzed in toto, but discrete devices and software applications should be evaluated. This evaluation should be based upon the rights implications, as opposed to the particular functions of the contractware device. So, while devices that prevent the usage of personal property could be allowed, implants that enforce unconstitutional contracts or contracts that are unconscionable or void against public policy would not be permitted.  These are questions for judges to decide on a case-by-case basis. Common law principles ought to form the background of such analysis."
