To consider whether blockchain technology can enable a permanent records on must understand the meaning of permancence in context.  The logical and scientific challenges raised by the general concept of a "permanent record" are considerable (perhaps unsurmountable). General consensus or widely accepted standards from law, policy and practice are also lacking a crisp definition, scope or criteria.

According to the [Dr. Micah Altman](http://informatics.mit.edu), the MIT Libraries Director of Research and Head Scientist, from an archival perspective, one can say that a long-term institutional committment is usually needed to provide credible assurance of "long term" records preservation (he chose not comment on the concept of a "permanent" committment).  Informally, one can guess perhaps a 50 year committment would be a credible approximation of what might be intended in general practice as a "permanent" record preservation.
