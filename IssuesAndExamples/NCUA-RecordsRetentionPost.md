The National Credit Union Administration ([NCUA](https://www.ncua.gov)) governs US Federal Credit Unions.  The [NCUA](https://www.ncua.gov) formal guidance for [federally-insured credit unions]( for federally-insured credit unions, Part 749 of NCUA’s regulations ) contained in Part 749 of [NCUA's](https://www.ncua.gov) regulations is not terribly prescriptive. In fact, [NCUA](http://nafcucomplianceblog.typepad.com/nafcu_weblog/2016/07/oldie-but-goodie-record-retention-.html) notes first the importance of following applicable state law under [Appendix A to Part [749](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=21ab23ef124e366686e46d1e1bcef3e9&mc=true&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title12/12cfr749_main_02.tpl) in determining how long to keep particular records:

> What Are the Recommended Minimum Retention Times?

> Record destruction may impact the credit union's legal standing to collect on loans or defend itself in court. Since each state can impose its own rules, it is prudent for a credit union to consider consulting with local counsel when setting minimum retention periods. A record pertaining to a member's account that is not considered a vital record may be destroyed once it is verified by the supervisory committee. Individual Share and Loan Ledgers should be retained permanently. Records, for a particular period, should not be destroyed until both a comprehensive annual audit by the supervisory committee and a supervisory examination by the NCUA have been made for that period. (Emphasis added.) 

NCUA guidance also notes that certain records should be retained permanently, including:

*   The FCU’s charter, bylaws and amendments to these documents
*   Minutes of membership meetings and meetings of the board, credit committee and supervisory committee
*   Copies of the FCU’s call report (NCUA Form 5300 or 5310) and the Credit Union Profile Report (NCUA Form 4501) or its equivalent
*   One copy of each supervisory committee annual audit report and attachments
*   Supervisory committee records of account verification
*   Journal and cash record
*   General ledger
*   Copies of periodic statements or the individual share and loan ledger (meaning, “a complete record of the account should be kept permanently)
*   Bank reconcilements
*   Listing of records destroyed

Part 749 also addresses vital records preservation and can be helpful when reviewing recordkeeping policies and procedures.

From a federal regulatory perspective, specific rules often have their own record retention provisions. Here are some examples:

Regulation Z addresses record retention in [section 1026.25](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID%3Dbc8649c04194e4b989a32c5c6cbf76fb%26mc%3Dtrue%26node%3Dse12.9.1026_125%26rgn%3Ddiv8&sa=D&ust=1498356573029000&usg=AFQjCNFvojbznDVAF5_SRgX3KOCoJ7PU3Q). The rule contains a general 2 year record retention requirement, with some longer retention periods for other specific documents. For example, there is a three year record retention requirement for information relating to loan originator compensation and the ability to repay/qualified mortgage rule. For loans subject to TRID, credit unions must retain evidence of compliance for three years, but all Closing Disclosures, including revised Closing Disclosures, must be retained for five years post-consummation.

Regulation B has a [particular records retention rule](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID%3D600feb2e3758a854a2f0ae0a3dbc570a%26node%3D12:8.0.2.8.2.0.1.12%26rgn%3Ddiv8&sa=D&ust=1498356573030000&usg=AFQjCNFWSmWCHzv32rSObxAikQw6vUDrfA) found in §1002.12 and [a requirement](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID%3D600feb2e3758a854a2f0ae0a3dbc570a%26node%3D12:8.0.2.8.2.0.1.12%26rgn%3Ddiv8&sa=D&ust=1498356573030000&usg=AFQjCNFWSmWCHzv32rSObxAikQw6vUDrfA) to keep in the application file a copy of any written notice that was required to be mailed under the regulation. There are more specific requirements relating to business credit, keeping records longer if the credit union knows it is under investigation by a regulator or state’s attorney general, and requires credit unions to keep records relating to prescreened offers of credit for 25 months so it may be worth reviewing in full. The [rule’s commentary](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp%3D%26SID%3D6852755b7981b2799ab8716d46c243ab%26mc%3Dtrue%26n%3Dpt12.8.1002%26r%3DPART%26ty%3DHTML%23ap12.8.1002_116.1&sa=D&ust=1498356573031000&usg=AFQjCNGAIbQX_C8AbnQn6xaQGwed-mE-5A) discusses keeping computerized records of notice.

Bank Secrecy Act. The BSA/AML examination manual contains an [appendix on record retention requirements](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/OLM_116.htm&sa=D&ust=1498356573032000&usg=AFQjCNH7leOydkxZLMykMMBwuI0JdhGHpA). Some records must be kept for 5 years, such as purchases of monetary instruments or funds transfers of $3,000 or more (although there are some exceptions here). Records under the credit union’s customer identification program (CIP) must be retained for five years after the account is closed.  Other BSA provisions are not subject to a specific record retention timeframe. However, to ease compliance, many credit unions keep all BSA-related records for 5 years rather than having to sort out which items are specifically required to be kept for 5 years and which are not.

Other federal rules. Here are a few other federal regulations with specific recordkeeping provisions:

*   Regulation E, [section 1005.13(b)](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID%3D5c21e9520c115b43c457d935b797c162%26mc%3Dtrue%26node%3Dse12.8.1005_113%26rgn%3Ddiv8&sa=D&ust=1498356573034000&usg=AFQjCNGZeO5u7SOcXpoEvcNL7OeDBOXIAg) (generally, two years from the time of providing disclosures)
